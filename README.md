# Secret Space Santa

## History

This application was originally built to manage a Secret Santa event for the Young ESRIN community in 2015.

The initial development took less than 3 hours. It was just a small exercise to showcase how fast one can prototype an application with Meteor (see old-meteor branch).

## Current State

The application has been rewritten and now uses

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), and
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Development Instructions



## Example: Deployment with Vercel and MongoDB Atlas

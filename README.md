# Secret Space Santa

This application was originally built to manage the upcoming Secret Santa event for the Young ESRIN community in 2015.

It uses cutting-edge technology to handle the *vast amount of data*, eg.

- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
                 
## Important Note

The initial development of the entire application took less than 3 hours. It was just a small exercise to showcase how fast one can prototype an application with Meteor. Don't take this little experiment too seriously!
